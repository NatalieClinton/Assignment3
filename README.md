# Assignment3 - Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

As a payroll manager, I created an employee payroll tracker to collect data for my company's budgeting purposes.

## Demo

The GIF below is what they'd like my tracker to look like.

The photo below shows the console with computed and aggregated data.

## The Creation

I created this repository which includes all the neccesary files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As requested- I created the following functions to make the starter code function as displayed in the previously referenced GIF and photo:

- collectEmployees: This function will allow a user to add multiple employees to display on the page.  The user will need to enter the first name, last name, and salary of each employee, then have the option to keep adding employees until they choose to stop. A while loop will be needed here (MDN Web Docs on while loops) The salary will need to be entered as a number, otherwise it should default to $0. 
- displayAverageSalary: This function will take in the generated array of employees and log the average salary and number of employees to the console.
- getRandomEmployee: This function will take in the generated array of employees, randomly select one employee, and use a template literal to log their full name to the console.
